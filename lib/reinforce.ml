(** Note: This is a scaffolding implementation. To make it functional:
    1. Implement actual neural network forward/backward passes
    2. Connect to a deep learning framework (e.g., Owl, TensorFlow OCaml bindings)
    3. Implement proper gradient computation and parameter updates
    4. Add action masking for invalid actions
    5. Consider adding entropy regularization
